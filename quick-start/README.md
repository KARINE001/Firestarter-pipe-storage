## ðŸ”§ After Installation - Complete Setup

### Step 1: Switch to Firestarter User
```bash
sudo su - firestarter
```

### Step 2: Create Your Account
```bash
pipe new-user
```
- Enter a username (suggestion: `your-name-firestarter`)
- Confirm account creation

### Step 3: Get Your Wallet Address
```bash
pipe check-token
```
**Copy the "Pubkey" address** - you'll need it for the faucet.

### Step 4: Fund Your Wallet
1. **Visit SOL DevNet Faucet**: https://faucet.solana.com/
2. **Paste your Pubkey address** from Step 3
3. **Request 1 SOL DevNet** (free)
4. **Wait ~30 seconds** for confirmation

### Step 5: Swap SOL for PIPE Tokens
```bash
pipe swap-sol-for-pipe 0.1
```
**Expected output:**
```
Swap SOL -> PIPE complete!
SOL spent: 0.1
PIPE minted: 1
```

### Step 6: Verify Everything Works
```bash
./pipe-test.sh
```
